#  Who are the Houston Texans?

The Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston, Texas. The team competes in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The Texans first played in 2002 as an expansion team, making them the youngest franchise in the NFL currently.

The Houston Texans were founded on December 30, 1999. The team's name and logo were unveiled on January 15, 2000. The Texans competed in the NFL as an expansion team in 2002, playing their first game against the Dallas Cowboys at the Texas Stadium on September 8. The Texans defeated the Cowboys 19-10. In 2003, the Texans began playing their home games at Reliant Stadium.

The Texans replaced the Cleveland Browns as members of the AFC North division following the 2002 season when then-Browns owner Art Modell announced his intention to relocate his team to Baltimore, which led to widespread criticism and lawsuits from Cleveland fans opposed to the move.

In 2004, quarterback David Carr suffered a season-ending injury, forcing backup Matt Schaub into service. Schaub led the Texans to their first winning season ever with a record of 9–7 and their first playoff berth. The following season, Schaub once again led Houston to a playoff berth and an AFC South championship with a 12–4 record.

In 2008, Houston started 4-0 but finished the season 5-11 after quarterback Matt Schaub was lost for the season with injury. Head coach Gary Kubiak was fired after six seasons with the Texans ending with a 2-14 record. He was replaced by Wade Phillips who led them to their second AFC South championship game appearance in 2011 but lost 31-10 to the Baltimore Ravens. On January 5, 2012, Phillips was fired after going 1-3 in four games as interim head coach including losses in Weeks 16 and 17 that eliminated them from playoff contention and gave rival Indianapolis Colts their first ever AFC South division championship title.

On January 3, 2014, Bill O'Brien was named head coach of the Texans.[14] O'Brien led the team to back-to-back AFC South division championships in 2015 and 2016 but lost both times in divisional round playoffs to eventual conference champions New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers respectively.

#  What does Picasso paint?

The answer to this question has long been a matter of debate for art historians and enthusiasts alike. Many believe that Picasso was a painter who defied definition, and that his work cannot easily be categorized. However, there are certain constants in Picasso's painting style which can be identified and explored.

To start with, Picasso tended to focus on the human form in his paintings. He frequently used oil paint to depict people in various states of emotion or activity, often using bright colors to create an intense effect. Additionally, many of Picasso's paintings featured distorted perspectives and angles, giving them a jarring, non-traditional feel.

Interestingly, despite his focus on the human form, Picasso was not always interested in portraying his subjects realistically. In fact, he often took liberties with their physical appearances in order to communicate something about them through his paintings. This is most evident in his famous "Guernica" mural, which is widely considered to be one of the artist's most important pieces.

In conclusion, while it is impossible to say definitively what Picasso paints, it is clear that he has a unique style which sets him apart from other painters. His paintings are often characterized by their abstract elements and focus on the human figure. Additionally, they often provoke an emotional reaction from viewers, due to their jarring perspectives and bright colors.
