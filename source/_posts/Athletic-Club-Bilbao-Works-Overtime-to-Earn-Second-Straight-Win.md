#  Athletic Club Bilbao Works Overtime to Earn Second Straight Win

Athletic Club Bilbao played an intense match against Sevilla in order to earn their second consecutive victory.

The first half of the match was quite balanced, as both teams had opportunities to score. However, Bilbao was the one who managed to take the lead thanks to a goal by Aritz Aduriz.

In the second half, Sevilla tried to equalize the match, but they were not successful. On the contrary, Athletic Club Bilbao managed to score another goal, thanks to Inaki Williams.

This victory allows Athletic Club Bilbao to stay close to the top of the La Liga table.

#  Athletic Bilbao's Winless Streak Continues After Unimpressive Display

Athletic Bilbao's 0-0 draw against Levante on Wednesday continued the club's winless streak in La Liga. The performance was highly unimpressive, with Athletic barely managing to create any chances throughout the game.

This result means that Athletic sit in 12th place in the league table, with just six points from their first seven games. Manager Gaizka Garitano will be hoping that his side can start picking up some wins soon, as they look to avoid relegation this season.

Athletic's next match is a home game against Celta Vigo, and they will be looking to pick up all three points in order to move up the table.

#  Squad rotation pays off for Athletic Club Bilbao against Getafe

After a fairly disappointing season by Athletic Club Bilbao's high standards, the club decided to shake up the squad with a number of new signings and a change in the coaching staff. This new-look Athletic side started the season slowly, but after a tweak to the formation and a switch to a squad rotation policy, things are starting to click.

The latest example of this was on Saturday when Athletic Club Bilbao beat Getafe 2-0. The victory was sealed by second-half goals from Inaki Williams and Aritz Aduriz, two players who had come off the bench only minutes before.

This was the sixth win in eight games for Athletic Club Bilbao and it has been achieved largely through squad rotation. With so many new players in the side, it was important that manager Gaizka Garitano had enough depth in his squad to be able to rotate his players without losing too much in terms of quality.

So far, this has proved to be the case, with several players hitting good form at just the right time. Inaki Williams is one example; he had been struggling for form earlier in the season, but has now scored in each of his last three appearances.

Athletic Club Bilbao will now hope to continue their good run of form and finish the season strongly. With Europa League qualification still up for grabs, they will be determined to make the most of their current form.

#  Late Goal Gives Athletic Club Bilbao 3 Points in Girona Clash

In a clash between two of the top sides in La Liga, Athletic Club Bilbao were able to secure all three points with a late goal from Iñaki Williams.

The first half was a tight affair, with both teams having chances but not being able to take advantage. Girona had the better of the play early on and thought they had taken the lead when Aday Benitez’s header hit the post and went in, but the goal was ruled out for offside.

The second half was more open, but it was Athletic Club Bilbao who finally got on the scoresheet in the 82nd minute when Iñaki Williams headed home from close range after being played in by Inigo Lekue.

Girona pushed for an equaliser in the closing stages, but they were unable to find one and Athletic Club Bilbao held on for the win.

#  Athletic Club Bilbao earns hard-fought point against La Liga leaders

Athletic Club Bilbao earned a hard-fought point against La Liga leaders FC Barcelona in a 1-1 draw at the San Mamés Stadium on Saturday.

The home side were the better team for long periods of the game and created more chances, but they were unable to take all three points as Ivan Rakitić's first-half volley cancelled out Aritz Aduriz's opener.

Bilbao came out of the blocks quickly and took the lead in the seventh minute when Aduriz finished from close range after Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen had failed to hold onto Sabin Merino's shot.

The goal was just reward for Bilbao's energetic start, and they continued to dominate proceedings throughout the first half.

Barcelona improved after the break, but they were still second best until Rakitić volleyed home Neymar's cross in the 41st minute.

The visitors had chances to win the game in the second half, but Ter Stegen made some good saves to keep them at bay.

In the end, a point apiece was a fair result in a game that saw both teams have spells of dominance.
