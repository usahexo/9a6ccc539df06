#  Get up to 85% back on your Taxable Casino Winnings!

Casinos can be great places to let loose and have some fun, but they can also be a great way to earn some extra cash. Depending on your luck, you could walk away with a healthy sum of money. If that happens, you might be wondering what to do with your casino winnings.

While you can certainly spend your money any way you please, you may also be able to get a portion of it back in the form of taxes. The good news is that you can get up to 85% of your taxable casino winnings back! Here’s how:

1. Determine if your winnings are taxable. Not all casino winnings are taxable. In general, only the amount of money you win that is above your initial stake is taxable. So, if you deposited $100 and won $300, only the additional $200 would be taxable.

2. Figure out your tax rate. Your tax rate will depend on your income and filing status. You can use this handy tool from the IRS to help figure out what your tax rate will be.

3. File your taxes accordingly. Once you know how much of your winnings are taxable and at what tax rate, you can file your taxes accordingly. Be sure to include any gambling losses as well- these can be used to offset any gambling income.

4. Collect your refund! Once your taxes are filed, you will receive a refund if appropriate. This refund will come in the form of a check or direct deposit, depending on how you filed your taxes. Be sure to cash or deposit it promptly so that you can start enjoying those casino wins!

Casino enthusiasts often wonder what the highest tax rate on casino winnings is in their respective countries. For example, in France gambling winnings are taxed at a rate of 45%. In the United States, gambling income is generally subject to a flat 29% federal income tax rate. However, this is not the case for those that reside in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Residents of the UAE who earn gambling income pay a whopping 55% tax on those winnings! This makes the UAE one of the most unfavorable countries in which to gamble from a taxation perspective. Are there any other countries with similarly high casino taxes?

Believe it or not, but there are several countries with even higher tax rates on casino winnings than the UAE. Let’s take a look at five of them.
