#  How the Grinch Stole Christmas – and Bingo Bacon Too!

It was the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there. But one creature was wide awake; the Grinch was planning his big heist.

He’d been eyeing up Christmas for weeks, scheming and planning how to steal it away. He knew there was only one way to do it – he’d have to take out Santa Claus himself.

So the Grinch put on his disguise and headed down to the North Pole. He creeped into Santa’s workshop and waited for him to come back from his rounds. When Santa finally returned, the Grinch pounced on him, knocking him out cold.

He then proceeded to take all of Santa’s presents and toys, loading them into his bag. He even took Bingo Bacon, the reindeer who pulling Santa’s sleigh.

The Grinch was feeling pretty good about himself as he made his way back home. But little did he know that one of Santa’s elves had seen everything and was following him.

When the Grinch got home, he put Bingo Bacon in his pen and went to bed, thinking he’d pulled off the perfect crime. But when he woke up in the morning, there was a note from Santa saying that he’d be back soon to get his presents back.

The Grinch was so angry that he tore apart his whole house looking for Bingo Bacon. But no matter how hard he looked, Bingo Bacon was nowhere to be found. The Grinch had finally been foiled – thanks to Bingo Bacon!
