There’s no doubt that casino bonuses are a great way to get started at a new online casino. They can give you a head start on your bankroll, and allow you to play longer and have more fun while you’re at it. But what happens when the bonus runs out?

For example, a deposit match bonus will give you a certain percentage of your deposit back in bonus funds, while a no-deposit bonus allows you to play without making any initial deposits.

Which one you choose depends on your own playing style and preferences. If you want to get started right away, then a no-deposit bonus is probably the best option. But if you want to increase your bankroll with a larger bonus, then go for a deposit match instead.

Once you’ve chosen your bonus, it’s important to read through the terms and conditions carefully before signing up. This is where you’ll find out exactly what the wagering requirements are, as well as other important information like maximum bet amounts and game restrictions.

Make sure that you understand all of these requirements before deciding whether or not to take the bonus – after all, there’s no point in accepting a bonus if you can’t actually meet the wagering requirements!

# 3: Make your first deposit

Once everything is cleared up, it’s time to make your first deposit and claim the bonus. Most casinos will offer you a generous welcome package which gives you several matching bonuses on your first few deposits. So make sure to take advantage of this offer and boost your bankroll right from the start!
