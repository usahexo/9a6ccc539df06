#  When did the Steelers last make the playoffs?

The Steelers have been in the playoffs a total of eighteen times, with their last appearance being in the 2016-2017 season.

#  How many Super Bowl championships have they won?

The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL), as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933, the team has won six Super Bowl championships, tied for the most of any NFL franchise.

The Steelers were founded on July 8, 1933, by Art Rooney, who as a youth had played football and rugby for sports clubs in the Pittsburgh area. The Steelers' name was derived from the team's original hometown of Steeltown, Pennsylvania. 

The Steelers did not play their first game until September 20, 1933, losing 23–0 to the Philadelphia Eagles. They did not score their first points until the following week, on a safety by Ed Perkowski. The team went on to finish their first season with a record of 1–11.

The following year, the Steelers improved to 4–7. In 1936, they hired head coach Johnny Idzik and led themselves to an 8–3 record—the first winning record in franchise history. However, they failed to win the division championship and settled for second place behind the Chicago Bears. In 1938, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the Phil-Pitt Eagles and finished with a 9–3 record in their only season together; however this was not enough to make them playoff contenders. 1940 saw the Steelers achieve an 11-1 mark under head coach Jock Sutherland and win their very first divisional title; this was followed by two consecutive defeats of Washington Redskins in 1941 (41-21) and 1942 (14-6). However, these victories were vacated due to cheating allegations against Joe Lillard and John Henry Johnson which became known as "the last great NFL scandal." 

In 1944 Coach Sutherland led his squad to an all-time team best 14-1 season result including an undefeated home record at Forbes Field; which was capped off with their third straight divisional championship over Brooklyn Dodgers however they eventually lost 21-0 against New York Giants in Tier One Championship game - considered one of worst losses in team history . 1946 marked their sixth consecutive victory over Washington Redskins with another championship win that made way for advance into 1947 NFL Championship game but lost again 14-0 against Chicago Bears  Despite these losses over time Coach Sutherland had brought his career coaching win/loss percentage up to 68%. Art Rooney fired Sutherland due to financial reasons stemming from dwindling attendance numbers caused by competitive baseball teams like Pirates and Negro leagues taking some of Steelers fan base  In 1948 former player Bill Dudley took over coaching role but only lasted half a season leading team to 1-10 record  1949 marked arrival Haywood Harris who then turned Steeler fortunes around leading them back into playoffs 1951 however lost 12-7 against Los Angeles Rams due in part to Harris being injured during the game  After Harris' departure Eddie Gottfried finished out season going 3-9 which led Gottfried being replaced by Buddy Parker for 1953 season .

After somewhat mediocre coaching records throughout 1950s Eddie DeBartolo Sr purchased majority stake in 1970 which gave him control over who became coach and more importantly General Manager leading way for Chuck Noll who began career as defensive coordinator 1969 under then head coach Weeb Ewbank with Baltimore Colts . Noll immediately went about changing image of dismal Steeler squad and began drafting players like Terry Bradshaw & Franco Harris whom later would help bring 4 Lombardi trophies back home to Pittsburgh 1979 1981 1984 1987 ; becoming one of few coaches/teams in NFL history to ever do so .

In the Playoffs, they made it all the way to the Finals but lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1.
