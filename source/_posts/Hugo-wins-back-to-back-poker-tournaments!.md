Just a few months ago, Hugo was crowned the champion of the $10,000 buy-in PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) Main Event. This week, he proved that was no fluke by taking down the $25,000 buy-in PCA High Roller event, earning himself another impressive title and $1.5 million in prize money.

This latest win cements Hugo's status as one of the world's best poker players; in fact, he is now second on the all-time money list for high rollers, with over $19 million in career earnings.

What's even more impressive is that Hugo is still just 21 years old – making him one of the youngest players to ever achieve such success in professional poker. In an interview after his latest win, Hugo attributed his success to deep thinking and never giving up; "I always think about the consequences of my moves," he said. "And I never give up; I keep fighting until the end."

It's this determination and refusal to give up that has seen Hugo dominate some of the most challenging high roller tournaments in the world. With his youthful energy and aggressive playing style, it's clear that Hugo still has plenty more to achieve in the world of poker. We can't wait to see what else he has up his sleeve!

#  Another impressive victory for Hugo in the poker world!

## On September 8th, Hugo made history by winning the World Series of Poker's "Big One for One Drop" tournament and becoming the first French player to ever do so.

The event, which had a buy-in of $1 million, drew in some of the world's best poker players, but Hugo was able to come out on top, taking home the $10 million first prize.

This latest win is just the latest in a long line of successes for Hugo in the poker world. In 2013, he won the European Poker Tour (EPT) title, and in 2016 he took down the World Poker Tour (WPT) title.

Clearly, Hugo is one of the best poker players in the world and shows no signs of slowing down. With more big wins sure to come his way, we can only wait to see what incredible feats he will achieve next.
