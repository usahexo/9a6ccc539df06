#  Netherlands legalizes recreational use of cannabis

On October 17, 2018, the Dutch Parliament voted in favor of legalizing recreational cannabis throughout the Netherlands. This makes the Netherlands the first country in the world to do so.

The bill, which was proposed by the governing party D66, will allow adults to purchase up to five grams of cannabis from licensed retailers. It will also allow adults to grow up to five plants at home for personal use.

Minister Hugo de Jonge of Public Health said that the new law will make it easier for adults to access cannabis legally, while also keeping cannabis away from children. He added that the government will invest in prevention programs to educate children about the risks of cannabis use.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased crime and drug addiction. However, supporters believe that it will help reduce crime and create jobs.

The new law is expected to come into effect in early 2020.

#  Dutch Diagnose: Cannabis Use Disorder on the Rise

Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world. The majority of users smoke it, but recent years have seen an increase in the use of cannabis concentrates, such as hash oil and wax.

Although cannabis is illegal in many countries, its legal status varies from country to country. In some places, such as the Netherlands, it is decriminalized and in others it is fully legalized for both medical and recreational use.

Despite its widespread use, cannabis is not without risks. Regular use can lead to dependence and addiction (cannabis use disorder), which can have a negative impact on both physical and mental health.

In recent years, the number of people seeking treatment for cannabis use disorder has been increasing. A study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that the number of people seeking treatment for cannabis use disorder increased by 58 percent between 2002 and 2010.

The study also found that people seeking treatment for cannabis use disorder were younger than those seeking treatment for other substance use disorders. The average age of people seeking treatment for cannabis use disorder was 29, compared to 38 for alcohol use disorder and 40 for cocaine abuse.

The reason for the increase in cannabis use disorder is not clear, but it may be due to increased availability of high-potency strains of cannabis and the increasing popularity of concentrates.

People with cannabis use disorder may experience cravings, loss of control over their drug use, withdrawal symptoms when they stop using, and impaired functioning in social and occupational settings.

People with this condition often require specialized treatment that includes counseling and behavioral therapies.

#  The joker is not wild in blackjack say Dutch regulators

In the Netherlands, the Gaming Authority has ruled that the joker is not wild in blackjack. This means that players cannot use the joker as a substitute for any other card to make a winning hand.

The Gaming Authority made this ruling in response to a complaint from a player who claimed that the casino had refused to pay him his winnings because the joker was not wild. The authority determined that the casino was in fact correct in its refusal, as blackjack is played with specific rules that prohibit using the joker as a wild card.

This ruling could have implications for casinos elsewhere in Europe, as blackjack is a popular game throughout the continent. It could also cause players to rethink their strategy when playing blackjack, as the joker no longer represents an automatic winning hand.

#  Netherlands to open first cannabis coffee shops in July

The Netherlands is all set to open its first cannabis coffee shops in July this year. The countryâ€™s justice minister, Ferdinand Grapperhaus, announced the move on Friday.

Cannabis coffee shops have been around in the Netherlands for a long time now, but they have always been operated illegally. The government has now decided to legalise and regulate these establishments in a bid to bring them under control.

According to Grapperhaus, the new regulations will ensure that only those aged 18 or over will be able to enter cannabis coffee shops. He also said that the coffee shops will not be allowed to sell any other type of drug apart from cannabis.

Grapperhaus added that he is confident that the new regulations will strike the right balance between upholding public safety and respecting freedom of choice. He also said that the government is committed to tackling the black market for cannabis.

Cannabis coffee shops have been a fixture in Dutch society for decades now. They are often seen as a safe haven for smokers, who can buy cigarettes and cannabis from the same place.

However, the government has been progressively cracking down on these establishments in recent years. In April 2016, the government announced plans to close all cannabis coffee shops within 500 metres of schools.

#  Amsterdam's oldest coffeeshop closes its doors after being forced to go 'black'

Amsterdam's oldest coffeeshop is to close its doors after being forced to go 'black'. The Bulldog, which has been in business since 1975, announced the closure on its website, blaming the move on 'bad politics'.

The Bulldog has been a mainstay of the Dutch capital's cannabis scene for over 40 years, but it looks like its days are now numbered. In a statement on its website, the company said that it had been forced to close all of its coffeeshops in Amsterdam and would instead focus on its businesses outside of the city.

This isn't the first time that the Bulldog has had to downsize; back in 2010 it closed four of its Amsterdam coffeeshops due to increased regulation. Now, with the closure of its original outlet, it seems that things have gone from bad to worse for the chain.

So why has the Bulldog been forced out of Amsterdam? Well, there's no one answer to that question; rather, it's a combination of factors that have led to this situation. For a start, there's been a crackdown on cannabis coffeeshops in recent years, with authorities striving to close as many establishments as possible.

In addition, there have also been changes to the law that make it tougher for coffeeshops to operate. For example, shops can no longer sell cannabis products if they're within 250 metres of schools or other places where youngsters might congregate. This has made life increasingly difficult for coffeeshops in Amsterdam and elsewhere in Holland.
