#  Broncos doubling down on bad luck

It was a tale of two seasons for the Denver Broncos. First, they were one of the best teams in the NFL, going unbeaten through their first eight games. Then they lost three of their last four games to finish the season with a 9-7 record – and missed the playoffs.

There are plenty of reasons for the Broncos’ late-season collapse, but one of the biggest may have been their bad luck. According to one study, the Broncos were among the most unlucky teams in the NFL in 2017. They had a league-high nine fumble recoveries by their opponents, and also recovered just 31 percent of fumbles on offense (league average: 39 percent). That led to them losing an estimated 14 points due to unlucky bounces – more than any other team in the NFL.

It’s no wonder then that John Elway & Co. decided to make some changes this offseason, including adding some new players (such as quarterback Case Keenum) and firing head coach Vance Joseph. But will that be enough to overcome Denver’s bad luck?

It remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: The Broncos will need all the good luck they can get if they want to return to the playoffs in 2018.

#   Broncos hope doubling their bets will lead to a win

The Denver Broncos are coming into the 2017-2018 NFL season with new hope. After a disappointing 5-11 season last year, the team is looking to turn things around with a couple of key off-season acquisitions. One of those acquisitions—former Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott—could be crucial to their success this year.

The Broncos have been busy in the offseason, making a number of moves that they hope will improve their fortunes this year. In addition to signing Elliott, they also acquired quarterback Case Keenum and offensive linemen Ronald Leary and Menelik Watson. They also re-signed linebacker Von Miller and cornerback Chris Harris Jr., both of whom are key players on defense.

These moves come after a season in which the Broncos’ offense was one of the worst in the league. In fact, they were one of just three teams that failed to score 300 points. The team is hoping that Elliott can help improve things on that side of the ball. He’s coming off a banner year in Dallas in which he rushed for 1,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/)631 yards and 15 touchdowns.

One concern for the Broncos is whether or not Elliott can keep up his high level of play now that he’s playing for a new team. Another question mark is Keenum, who has never been a full-time starter in the NFL. However, if he can play even close to the level he did last year for the Minnesota Vikings (3,547 yards, 22 touchdowns, 7 interceptions), then the Broncos should be able to compete for a playoff spot.

It won’t be easy for them to get there, however. The AFC West is one of the strongest divisions in football, with three teams (the Broncos, Raiders and Chiefs) all having made it to the playoffs last year. The Chargers are also looking like they could be contenders this year after making some big moves in free agency.

If everything falls into place for them, however, don’t be surprised if you see the Broncos competing for a Super Bowl berth this year.

#   Denver Broncos continue to lose, but may have found a way to turn things around

At the midway point of the NFL season, the Denver Broncos sit at 3-5. This is not where they wanted to be, but it is not a disaster either. There are still six games left to play, and the Broncos could easily make the playoffs with a strong finish.

There have been some bright spots for the Broncos this year. Emmanuel Sanders has been one of the best receivers in the league, and Von Miller continues to be one of the most dominant defensive players in the NFL.

However, there have also been some major disappointments. The biggest disappointment has been quarterback Case Keenum. He was brought in as a free agent to be the starter, but he has not played well at all. He has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns, and his QBR is only 46.7.

The Broncos may have found their solution at quarterback though. In Week 9, they started rookie Drew Lock against the Minnesota Vikings. Lock played well, throwing for two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also had a QBR of 95.8.

If Lock can continue to play like that, he could very easily take over as the starter for the rest of the season. The Broncos are still alive in the playoff race, and if they want to make it to the postseason, they will need Lock to play well down the stretch.

#  Doubling your bet in blackjack not working for the Broncos 
The Denver Broncos are coming off of a Super Bowl victory, but they have not been able to replicate that success this season. In part, this is due to the fact that the team is not taking advantage of one of the simplest strategies in blackjack: doubling your bet when you have a good hand. 

In blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If your first two cards add up to 21, you have a blackjack and win automatically. If your total is less than 21, you can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (end your turn). Doubling your bet means that you are putting twice as much money on the table as you would normally, and it can be a great way to increase your chances of winning. 

The problem for the Broncos is that they are not getting good hands often enough to justify doubling their bets. In fact, according to FiveThirtyEight’s NFL win probability charts, their chance of winning when they Double Down is only about 48%. This is significantly lower than the 71% chance they have when they don’t double down. As a result, the team would be better off not doubling their bets most of the time and instead saving their money for when they have a better chance of winning. 

Of course, there are no guarantees in blackjack (or in life), and there will be times when it makes sense to go against these odds and double down anyway. But overall, the Broncos would be better off playing it safe and not betting so much money when their chances of winning are relatively low.

#  Broncos keep losing, despite doubling their bets

The Denver Broncos are in the midst of a five-game losing streak and have now covered just two spreads over that span. Bettors who have doubled their bets on the Broncos during this stretch are now down a significant amount of money.

Denver is coming off a 21-point home loss to the New England Patriots in Week 10 and is currently a 6.5-point underdog against the Kansas City Chiefs this week. The Broncos have failed to cover in each of their last four games as an underdog and are just 2-6 against the spread on the season.

Despite this, over 65% of bettors are still backing Denver to cover against Kansas City this week. This could be due to the fact that the Chiefs have also struggled somewhat this season, currently sporting a 4-5 record.

With both teams playing poorly as of late, it's hard to know which team will come out on top. Given Denver's recent track record, it seems like a risky bet to back them at this point. However, if they can manage to pull off the upset victory, those who took the gamble could stand to make some nice profits.
