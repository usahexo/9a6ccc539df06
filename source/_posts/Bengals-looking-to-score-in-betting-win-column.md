#  Bengals looking to score in betting win column

The Cincinnati Bengals went 8-7-1 ATS last season and would love to improve that number this season. In order to do so, they will need to score points. quarterback Andy Dalton averaged 216 passing yards per game last year and will need to be more productive if they want to cover the spread. Wide receiver A.J. Green is one of the best in the league and can help take some pressure of Dalton. The Bengals defense ranked 4th in the NFL last season in points allowed but struggled against the run, allowing 122 yards rushing per game. If they can improve their run defense, they could be a betting favorite this season.

#  NFL odds: Bengals a good bet at home against Falcons

The Cincinnati Bengals are a 4.5-point favorite at home against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 14 of the NFL season, according to OddsShark.

The Bengals have been a very good team at home this season, going 5-1 so far. They have beaten some good teams at home, including the Green Bay Packers and the Baltimore Ravens.

The Falcons, on the other hand, have not been very good on the road this season. They are just 2-4 away from home and have lost their last three games in a row.

The Bengals should be able to take advantage of the Falcons’ poor road record and win this game fairly easily.

#  Football Betting: Cincinnati Bengals vs. Houston Texans

In the AFC Playoff picture, the Cincinnati Bengals (10-5) are in line to snag the third seed, while the Houston Texans (9-6) are eyeing a wildcard berth. The Bengals come into this matchup having won three of their last four games, while the Texans have lost two straight.

Houston is led by rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson who is coming off an impressive season in which he passed for over 4,000 yards and ran for over 500 yards. Watson has been hampered by injuries recently, but is expected to start on Saturday. DeAndre Hopkins is one of Watson’s favorite targets and has caught 96 balls for 1,378 yards and 11 touchdowns this season.

The Bengals have a formidable defense anchored by linebacker Vontaze Burfict. Burfict is one of the most explosive linebackers in the league and will be looking to make life difficult for Watson on Saturday. Wide receiver A.J. Green is Cincinnati’s top offensive weapon and has caught 92 passes for 1,426 yards and eight touchdowns this season.

The game will likely be decided by who can control the trenches. The Bengals have been inconsistent on offense this season, but have a strong offensive line that should be able to control the game against Houston’s defensive front four. The Texans have had difficulty stopping opposing teams this season, so I expect Cincinnati to be able to move the ball effectively.

I am predicting a 24-14 victory for the Bengals in this matchup.

#  What toBet on the Bengals This Weekend? 

The Cincinnati Bengals will face the Washington Redskins this upcoming weekend. Both teams are coming off of losses and are looking to redeem themselves. So, what should you bet on the Bengals this weekend?

To start, let's take a look at the Bengals' stats from their last game. They had 374 yards of total offense, 189 passing and 185 rushing. Joe Mixon led the team in rushing with 62 yards on 15 carries, while A.J. Green led in receiving with 119 yards on seven catches. The Bengals also had 18 first downs, compared to the Redskins' 13.

The Redskins' defense isn't as strong as some of the other teams that the Bengals have faced this season. They're ranked 26th in total defense, giving up an average of 376 yards per game, including 242 passing and 134 rushing. In their last game, they allowed the Dallas Cowboys to have 401 yards of total offense, including 323 passing and 78 rushing.

So far this season, Washington is 2-2 and Cincinnati is 3-1. The Bengals are expected to win this game, with a odds of -6 according to OddsShark . With that being said, here are three bets you can make on the Bengals this weekend:

1) Bet on the Cincinnati Bengals -6 point spread 
2) Bet on over 45 points scored in the game 
3) Bet on Joe Mixon to have over 75 rushing yards

#  Is this the week the Cincinnati Bengals cover the spread?

The Bengals opened as 3.5-point road underdogs against the Cleveland Browns this week, but early action has driven the line up to 4.5 points heading into Saturday night’s matchup.

Cincinnati is coming off a 26-17 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 1, while the Browns earned a 21-21 tie against the New York Jets in their season opener.

Andy Dalton had a decent game for the Bengals last week, completing 25 of his 41 passes for 369 yards and two touchdowns. A.J. Green was his favorite target, hauling in 10 catches for 116 yards and a touchdown.

Bengals running back Joe Mixon also had a strong game, rushing for 95 yards on 17 carries. The former Oklahoma Sooner could be in for another big day against Cleveland’s tough defense.

The Browns played well defensively in their tie against the Jets, holding New York to just 248 total yards and 12 first downs. Rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield looked solid in his debut, completing 17 of 23 passes for 201 yards and a touchdown.

Cleveland’s biggest weakness is its run defense, which allowed Jets running back Isaiah Crowell to rush for 105 yards on just 10 carries last week. Mixon could have a big day against this defense if Cincinnati can get him the ball enough.

Given these factors, it looks like there’s value betting on the Bengals this week. Cincinnati should be able to keep things close with Cleveland, and there’s a good chance they cover the spread as 4.5-point road dogs
