#  Prometey's Poker Rooms Set to Reopen with Exciting New Features!

Poker fans around the world rejoiced this week as news broke that Prometey's Poker Rooms would be reopening its doors after a two-year hiatus.

The venerable poker room operator, which first opened its doors in Moscow in 2004, has been undergoing a major renovation in anticipation of its grand reopening on July 1st.

Among the new features being added to the rooms are an exciting new loyalty program and a host of innovative tournaments that are sure to please both beginners and seasoned veterans alike.

To celebrate the reopening, Prometey's is hosting a special "re-opening tournament" with a guaranteed prize pool of one million rubles (approximately $15,000).

"We're really excited about the reopening of our poker rooms," said Maxim Petrov, CEO of Prometey Gaming. "We've made a lot of changes and additions that we believe will make our rooms some of the best in the world."

According to Petrov, one of the most exciting new features is the room's new loyalty program, which offers gamblers rewards for playing at the tables. The more you play, the more points you earn, and these points can be redeemed for cash prizes or other perks such as complimentary hotel stays or access to exclusive VIP tournaments.

The room is also introducing several new tournament variants, including "speed poker" and "shootout tournaments". Speed poker is a variant of traditional Texas Hold'em that is played at turbo speed, while shootout tournaments are single-table tournaments where players are randomly assigned to different tables after the start of play. This ensures that all players have an equal chance of winning regardless of their starting stack size.

In addition to all these new features, Prometey's Poker Rooms will also offer its usual slate of games and tournaments including No Limit Texas Hold'em, Pot Limit Omaha, 7 Card Stud and more. So whether you're a beginner just looking to learn how to play or a seasoned pro looking for some action-packed competition, Prometey's Poker Rooms have something for you!

#  Poker Fans rejoice as Prometey announces poker rooms will reopen soon!

Poker fans rejoice as Prometey, the owner of several online poker rooms, announces that the rooms will reopen soon. In a statement on the company website, Prometey said that the decision to close the rooms was a difficult one but that it was necessary to protect the players.

“The safety of our players is our number-one priority and we felt that closing the rooms was the best way to ensure their safety,” said Prometey in a statement on the company website. “But we are happy to announce that the rooms will reopen soon and we are doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe for our players.”

Prometey did not announce a specific date for when the rooms would reopen but said that they would be open in time for the World Series of Poker. The company also plans to beef up its security measures in order to protect players from any potential scams or malicious actors.

The news was met with mixed reactions from poker players. Some were happy to hear that the rooms were reopening while others were concerned about the safety of their money. But many agreed that it was a positive sign that Prometey was taking steps to improve security and protect its players.

The announcement comes at a time when the global poker community is reeling from several high-profile scandals. Last month, two professional poker players were caught cheating during a major tournament in Las Vegas. The cheating scandal has raised concerns about the integrity of the game and put pressure on online poker room operators to step up their security measures.

Prometey’s announcement is seen as a step in the right direction and many hope that it will help restore confidence in online poker rooms.
