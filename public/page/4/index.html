<p>The funeral home, which is located in Odessa, Texas, found itself in the middle of a gunfight on Saturday after a man who was allegedly involved in the shooting showed up there. The funeral home is located about 410 miles away from the small town of Midland, Texas where the shootout took place.</p>
<p>The funeral home has been placed on lockdown and employees have been forced to take shelter after the man allegedly involved in the shooting showed up there on Saturday. The man had reportedly been involved in a shootout with police officers in Midland earlier that day and had fled to Odessa.</p>
<p>According to reports, the man drove to the funeral home and began firing his gun at random. He then entered the building and continued firing his gun while employees took cover. The man was later shot and killed by police officers outside of the funeral home.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the shooting at the funeral home, but three people were killed and two others were injured in the shootout earlier that day in Midland.</p>
<h1 id="Distance-Won’t-Detract-from-Tragedy-in-El-Paso"><a href="#Distance-Won’t-Detract-from-Tragedy-in-El-Paso" class="headerlink" title="Distance Won’t Detract from Tragedy in El Paso"></a>Distance Won’t Detract from Tragedy in El Paso</h1><p>In the face of an unspeakable tragedy, some people have tried to make distance a factor. It’s not just the gun laws. It’s not just the Texas-Mexico border. The shooter was born in the United States.</p>
<p>The backlash to these arguments has been swift and fierce, with outraged Americans countering that there is no difference between an American terrorist and a foreign terrorist. They are both equally abhorrent and deserve our condemnation.</p>
<p>But even as we confront this senseless act of violence, it is important to remember that what happened in El Paso was not simply an attack on America. It was an attack on Latino Americans, who have long been targeted by racists and xenophobes.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Latinos have been targeted in a mass shooting. In June 2016, a gunman killed 49 people at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida – most of them were Latino. And earlier this year, a white nationalist killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso – also predominantly Latino.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, political leaders were quick to offer their thoughts and prayers, but they failed to address the underlying causes of these shootings. They refused to confront the racism and hatred that motivated these attacks.</p>
<p>It’s time for our political leaders to take a stand against racism and hatred. We need to do more to create a safe and inclusive society for all Americans. We need to make sure that everyone feels welcome in our country, regardless of their race or ethnicity.</p>
<h1 id="Shooting-Sparks-Debate-Over-How-Far-is-Too-Far-for-a-Funeral-Home"><a href="#Shooting-Sparks-Debate-Over-How-Far-is-Too-Far-for-a-Funeral-Home" class="headerlink" title="Shooting Sparks Debate Over How Far is Too Far for a Funeral Home"></a>Shooting Sparks Debate Over How Far is Too Far for a Funeral Home</h1><p>Funeral homes have been around in some form for over 6,000 years, with the first documented occurrence in ancient Egypt. They’ve served as a place where the deceased can be mourned and laid to rest and have traditionally been seen as a somber place. In recent years though, a new trend has started to emerge in the funeral home industry – outrageous funerals.</p>
<p>There’s no set definition of what an outrageous funeral is, but they generally involve elements that are far outside the traditional scope of what a funeral is. Some of the most common features are large gatherings, excessive decorations, and over-the-top attire. Many people believe that these funerals are inappropriate and that they cross the line between honoring the deceased and exploiting them for shock value.</p>
<p>The shooting death of rapper Nipsey Hussle earlier this year sparked a heated debate over where to draw the line when it comes to funeral homes. Hussle was gunned down in front of his clothing store in Los Angeles and his memorial service was held at Staples Center, which can accommodate up to 21,000 people. The service was aired live on several television networks and featured performances by Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé. While many people praised Hussle’s family for putting on such an impressive event, others felt that it was too much and inappropriate given the circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>Some argue that outrageous funerals are nothing more than a way to grab attention and exploit the deceased. They say that there’s no need for such theatrics when grieving someone who has passed away and that these events only serve to further capitalize on tragedy. Others contend that there’s nothing wrong with celebrating someone’s life in a big way and that these funerals can actually be helpful in terms of closure for friends and family members. They say that if done tastefully, an outrageous funeral can be a fitting tribute to the deceased.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is there such a thing as going too far when it comes to funerals? Or is there no right or wrong answer? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
<h1 id="Tragedy-Reigns-Despite-Miles-Between-Casino-and-Mortuary"><a href="#Tragedy-Reigns-Despite-Miles-Between-Casino-and-Mortuary" class="headerlink" title="Tragedy Reigns Despite Miles Between Casino and Mortuary"></a>Tragedy Reigns Despite Miles Between Casino and Mortuary</h1><p>Las Vegas is a city built on luck. Glittering lights and towering hotels promise visitors the chance to change their fortunes. It’s the place where people come to forget their troubles and believe in the possibilities of luck and pleasure. But for some, luck never comes and tragedy reigns.</p>
<p>Miles away from the glitz and glamour of the casinos lies the mortuary. It’s here that bodies are prepared for burial or cremation, away from the prying eyes of those who still cling to hope. It’s a depressing place, made even more so by its proximity to the bright distractions of the strip.</p>
<p>This juxtaposition is on full display in The Mortuary Museum. Housed in what was once an actual mortuary, the museum showcases artifacts from around the city as well as photographs detailing some of its darker history. One exhibit shows a watch stopped at 4:20, the time many believe Howard Hughes died. His death was ruled a suicide, but there has long been speculation that he was murdered.</p>
<p>Another exhibit focuses on Starburst McGowan, a prostitute whose body was found in an alley behind Circus Circus hotel in 1978. She had been stabbed more than 30 times and her killers were never found. Her case remains open to this day.</p>
<p>The most popular exhibit is The Chair, which is said to have been used by several serial killers including Ted Bundy and Richard Ramirez. It’s said that Ramirez took particular glee in sitting in it while he inflicted pain on his victims.</p>
<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) its dark history, Las Vegas is a fascinating place to visit. The Mortuary Museum is just one small part of it and is well worth a visit for anyone interested in true crime or American history.</p>
<h1 id="Cutler-Neil-Mortuary-Tucked-Away-Nicely-Amidst-Horseshoe-Casino-Nearby"><a href="#Cutler-Neil-Mortuary-Tucked-Away-Nicely-Amidst-Horseshoe-Casino-Nearby" class="headerlink" title="Cutler-Neil Mortuary Tucked Away Nicely Amidst Horseshoe Casino Nearby"></a>Cutler-Neil Mortuary Tucked Away Nicely Amidst Horseshoe Casino Nearby</h1><p>Cutler-Neil Mortuary is a well-maintained, small cemetery that’s tucked away nicely amidst the Horseshoe Casino nearby. It offers a beautiful view of the downtown Cincinnati skyline and is a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p>The cemetery was founded in 1857 by William Cutler and William Neil and is currently operated by their descendants. It features both cremation and traditional burial options, as well as a pet cemetery. The property includes a gazebo, which can be used for memorial services, and a pond, which is home to several geese.</p>
<p>The grounds are impeccably kept and the staff is friendly and helpful. They offer guided tours upon request and will work with you to create a custom funeral or memorial service. Cutler-Neil Mortuary is a beautiful place to say goodbye to a loved one and is definitely worth checking out if you’re in the area.</p>

Depending on your luck, you could walk away with a healthy sum of money. If that happens, you might be wondering what to do with your casino winnings.</p>
<p>While you can certainly spend your money any way you please, you may also be able to get a portion of it back in the form of taxes. The good news is that you can get up to 85% of your taxable casino winnings back! Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Determine if your winnings are taxable. Not all casino winnings are taxable. In general, only the amount of money you win that is above your initial stake is taxable. So, if you deposited $100 and won $300, only the additional $200 would be taxable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Figure out your tax rate. Your tax rate will depend on your income and filing status. You can use this handy tool from the IRS to help figure out what your tax rate will be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>File your taxes accordingly. Once you know how much of your winnings are taxable and at what tax rate, you can file your taxes accordingly. Be sure to include any gambling losses as well- these can be used to offset any gambling income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Collect your refund! Once your taxes are filed, you will receive a refund if appropriate. This refund will come in the form of a check or direct deposit, depending on how you filed your taxes. Be sure to cash or deposit it promptly so that you can start enjoying those casino wins!</p>

Not at Golden Stallion Game!"></a>Highest Tax Rate on Casino Winnings? Not at Golden Stallion Game!</h1><p>Casino enthusiasts often wonder what the highest tax rate on casino winnings is in their respective countries. For example, in France gambling winnings are taxed at a rate of 45%. In the United States, gambling income is generally subject to a flat 29% federal income tax rate. However, this is not the case for those that reside in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
<p>Residents of the UAE who earn gambling income pay a whopping 55% tax on those winnings! This makes the UAE one of the most unfavorable countries in which to gamble from a taxation perspective. Are there any other countries with similarly high casino taxes?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, but there are several countries with even higher tax rates on casino winnings than the UAE. Let’s take a look at five of them.</p>
<p>5 Countries With The Highest Casino Tax Rates:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Norway: In Norway, gambling winnings are taxed at a rate of 65%. This is by far the highest casino tax rate in the world!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sweden: Sweden has a casino tax rate of 61%. This makes it the second highest taxing country for gambling earnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Denmark: Gambling winnings in Denmark are taxed at a rate of 56%. This places it as the third highest taxing country for casino earnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Germany: Germany imposes a 55% tax on gambling income. This puts it as the fourth highest taxing country when it comes to casinos and gaming earnings.</p>

So, if you’re looking for a way to make some serious money fast, read on for our top tips on how to win big in online casino games.</p>
<p>Choose the Right Game</p>
<p>Not all casino games offer the same chance of winning big money. Some games, like slots, have higher payouts than others, like blackjack. So, it’s important to do your research and choose the game that offers the best odds of winning.</p>
<p>Play with Maximum Betting Limits</p>
<p>Another way to increase your chances of winning big is to play with the maximum betting limits. This means that you’ll be placing the highest possible bets and therefore have the best chances of hitting the jackpot. Plus, it makes the game more exciting and thrilling when you’re playing for high stakes!</p>
<p>Stay within Your Budget</p>
<p>It’s important not to bet more than you can afford to lose. Even if you’re playing with maximum betting limits, it’s still possible to lose money if Lady Luck isn’t on your side. So always stick to a budget that you’re comfortable with and never gamble more than you can afford to lose.</p>

The casinos have been hyping it up for weeks and it definitely delivers.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. You can beat the dealer by having a higher total than them, or if they bust (go over 21).</p>
<p>There are a few different variations of the game that you can play, but basically they all work the same way. You can find BlackJack tables at just about any casino in Vegas, and the minimum bet is usually just $1.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with how to play BlackJack, there are usually plenty of dealers happy to teach you how to play. They will also give you some tips on how to improve your odds of winning.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have any experience playing BlackJack, I would suggest giving it a try while you’re in Vegas. The atmosphere at the casino table is always electric and it can be a lot of fun.</p>
<h1 id="Play-the-BlackJack-Game-and-experience-the-thrill-of-Vegas"><a href="#Play-the-BlackJack-Game-and-experience-the-thrill-of-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Play the BlackJack Game and experience the thrill of Vegas!"></a>Play the BlackJack Game and experience the thrill of Vegas!</h1><p>Planning a vacation to Las Vegas but not sure what to do while you’re there? Why not try your luck at the blackjack tables? This classic casino game is easy to learn but can be challenging to master, providing hours of excitement for players of all levels of experience.</p>
<p>To play blackjack, you’ll need to place a bet and then receive two cards face-up. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and you’ll Win if your total is higher than the dealer’s total without going over 21. You can Hit (take another card) or Stand (stick with the cards you have) as you try to achieve the best hand possible.</p>
<p>If you’re new to blackjack, it might be helpful to practice playing online first. This will give you a chance to learn the basic rules and strategies before risking any real money on the tables. There are plenty of free games available online, or you could try one of the many blackjack apps for mobile devices.</p>
<p>Once you feel comfortable with the game, it’s time to head to Las Vegas and try your luck at one of the casinos there. The city is home to some of the biggest and most famous blackjack tables in the world, so you’re sure to find a game that suits your style and budget. Just be sure to brush up on your strategy before sitting down at the table - nothing ruins a trip like losing all your money in a single casino session!</p>
<h1 id="Try-your-luck-at-the-BlackJack-Game-in-Vegas"><a href="#Try-your-luck-at-the-BlackJack-Game-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Try your luck at the BlackJack Game in Vegas!"></a>Try your luck at the BlackJack Game in Vegas!</h1><p> Vegas is a city known for its gambling, and the blackjack game is one of the most popular. If you’re looking to try your luck, head to one of the many casinos in Vegas and sit down at a blackjack table.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a simple game to learn but can be complicated to play well. The goal is to draw cards until you reach 21, or come as close as possible without going over. The dealer also draws cards and tries to get as close to 21 as possible, but if he goes over 21, he “busts” and players who didn’t go over win.</p>
<p>There are different variations of blackjack, but the basic rules are always the same. In some versions of the game, you can double down or split your cards if you want to risk more money in order to try and win bigger payouts.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure about how to play blackjack, don’t be afraid to ask the dealer for help or watch other players for a few hands before joining in. The best way to learn is by playing, so don’t be afraid to take a chance and see if Lady Luck is on your side!</p>
<h1 id="The-BlackJack-Game-is-the-ultimate-casino-experience-in-Vegas"><a href="#The-BlackJack-Game-is-the-ultimate-casino-experience-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="The BlackJack Game is the ultimate casino experience in Vegas!"></a>The BlackJack Game is the ultimate casino experience in Vegas!</h1><p>When you walk into a casino in Las Vegas, the first thing you see is the large BlackJack table. This game is always popular with players of all levels of experience, and it is one of the simplest casino games to learn.</p>
<p>The goal of BlackJack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer begins the game by dealing two cards to each player and two cards to himself. The player’s cards are face up, and the dealer’s cards are face down.</p>
<p>Players can either choose to take another card (hit) or stand pat with their current total. If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand. The player beats the dealer if their total is higher than the dealer’s total, but if both totals are the same then it is a push (no one wins or loses).</p>
<p>Below are some tips for playing BlackJack in a casino:</p>
<p>-Start with smaller bets until you become comfortable with the game.</p>
<p>-Never hit on 17 or above - this is a bad strategy and will almost always result in a loss.</p>
<p>-Ask for as many cards as you need to make a decision - there is no harm in asking for another card if you’re unsure what to do.</p>
<p>-Remember that when you bust, you lose your entire bet.</p>
<p>-The dealer must hit on 16 or below, so remember that it’s important not to go over 21.</p>
<h1 id="Get-a-taste-of-Vegas-with-the-BlackJack-Game"><a href="#Get-a-taste-of-Vegas-with-the-BlackJack-Game" class="headerlink" title="Get a taste of Vegas with the BlackJack Game!"></a>Get a taste of Vegas with the BlackJack Game!</h1><p>The Blackjack game is one of the most popular casino games. It is simple to learn, but offers a challenging and exciting experience. With a touch of strategy, this game can provide hours of fun.</p>
<p>Before starting the game, players must place their bet. The minimum bet is usually $1, but it can be higher at some casinos. Once the bets are placed, the dealer will give each player two cards face up. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player’s cards are totaled together and the Ace is worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what would make the best hand. Face cards are worth 10 points and all other cards are worth their number value.</p>
<p>Players can choose to either hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn). If they go over 21, they bust and lose the hand. If they hit and go over 21, that is also a bust, but they still lose only half their bet amount. The best hand possible is an Ace and a King (A-K) which would be worth 21 points.</p>
<p>After all players have had their turn, the dealer will then give himself two cards - one face up and one face down. The dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. He compares his total card points to those of the players and whoever is closest to 21 wins the hand - even if they go over! If there is a tie, it is called a push and no one wins or loses money on that particular hand.</p>
<p>The Blackjack game can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience and provides hours of fun for anyone who wants to try their luck at this classic casino game!</p>

<h1 id="How-many-Super-Bowl-championships-have-they-won"><a href="#How-many-Super-Bowl-championships-have-they-won" class="headerlink" title="How many Super Bowl championships have they won?"></a>How many Super Bowl championships have they won?</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American football team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL), as a member club of the league’s American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933, the team has won six Super Bowl championships, tied for the most of any NFL franchise.</p>
<p>The Steelers were founded on July 8, 1933, by Art Rooney, who as a youth had played football and rugby for sports clubs in the Pittsburgh area. The Steelers’ name was derived from the team’s original hometown of Steeltown, Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>The Steelers did not play their first game until September 20, 1933, losing 23–0 to the Philadelphia Eagles. They did not score their first points until the following week, on a safety by Ed Perkowski. The team went on to finish their first season with a record of 1–11.</p>
<p>The following year, the Steelers improved to 4–7. In 1936, they hired head coach Johnny Idzik and led themselves to an 8–3 record—the first winning record in franchise history. However, they failed to win the division championship and settled for second place behind the Chicago Bears. In 1938, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the Phil-Pitt Eagles and finished with a 9–3 record in their only season together; however this was not enough to make them playoff contenders. 1940 saw the Steelers achieve an 11-1 mark under head coach Jock Sutherland and win their very first divisional title; this was followed by two consecutive defeats of Washington Redskins in 1941 (41-21) and 1942 (14-6). However, these victories were vacated due to cheating allegations against Joe Lillard and John Henry Johnson which became known as “the last great NFL scandal.” </p>
<p>In 1944 Coach Sutherland led his squad to an all-time team best 14-1 season result including an undefeated home record at Forbes Field; which was capped off with their third straight divisional championship over Brooklyn Dodgers however they eventually lost 21-0 against New York Giants in Tier One Championship game - considered one of worst losses in team history . 1946 marked their sixth consecutive victory over Washington Redskins with another championship win that made way for advance into 1947 NFL Championship game but lost again 14-0 against Chicago Bears  Despite these losses over time Coach Sutherland had brought his career coaching win/loss percentage up to 68%. Art Rooney fired Sutherland due to financial reasons stemming from dwindling attendance numbers caused by competitive baseball teams like Pirates and Negro leagues taking some of Steelers fan base  In 1948 former player Bill Dudley took over coaching role but only lasted half a season leading team to 1-10 record  1949 marked arrival Haywood Harris who then turned Steeler fortunes around leading them back into playoffs 1951 however lost 12-7 against Los Angeles Rams due in part to Harris being injured during the game  After Harris’ departure Eddie Gottfried finished out season going 3-9 which led Gottfried being replaced by Buddy Parker for 1953 season .</p>
<p>After somewhat mediocre coaching records throughout 1950s Eddie DeBartolo Sr purchased majority stake in 1970 which gave him control over who became coach and more importantly General Manager leading way for Chuck Noll who began career as defensive coordinator 1969 under then head coach Weeb Ewbank with Baltimore Colts . Noll immediately went about changing image of dismal Steeler squad and began drafting players like Terry Bradshaw &amp; Franco Harris whom later would help bring 4 Lombardi trophies back home to Pittsburgh 1979 1981 1984 1987 ; becoming one of few coaches/teams in NFL history to ever do so .</p>

This was a significant improvement from their previous season where they had a record of 51-31.</p>
<p>Their Divisional Record was 27-3, which was the best in the League. They also had the best conference record with 34-7.</p>
<p>In the Playoffs, they made it all the way to the Finals but lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1.</p>
