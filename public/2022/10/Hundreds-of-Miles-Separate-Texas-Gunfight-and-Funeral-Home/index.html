<p>The funeral home, which is located in Odessa, Texas, found itself in the middle of a gunfight on Saturday after a man who was allegedly involved in the shooting showed up there. The funeral home is located about 410 miles away from the small town of Midland, Texas where the shootout took place.</p>
<p>The funeral home has been placed on lockdown and employees have been forced to take shelter after the man allegedly involved in the shooting showed up there on Saturday. The man had reportedly been involved in a shootout with police officers in Midland earlier that day and had fled to Odessa.</p>
<p>According to reports, the man drove to the funeral home and began firing his gun at random. He then entered the building and continued firing his gun while employees took cover. The man was later shot and killed by police officers outside of the funeral home.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the shooting at the funeral home, but three people were killed and two others were injured in the shootout earlier that day in Midland.</p>
<h1 id="Distance-Won’t-Detract-from-Tragedy-in-El-Paso"><a href="#Distance-Won’t-Detract-from-Tragedy-in-El-Paso" class="headerlink" title="Distance Won’t Detract from Tragedy in El Paso"></a>Distance Won’t Detract from Tragedy in El Paso</h1><p>In the face of an unspeakable tragedy, some people have tried to make distance a factor. It’s not just the gun laws. It’s not just the Texas-Mexico border. The shooter was born in the United States.</p>
<p>The backlash to these arguments has been swift and fierce, with outraged Americans countering that there is no difference between an American terrorist and a foreign terrorist. They are both equally abhorrent and deserve our condemnation.</p>
<p>But even as we confront this senseless act of violence, it is important to remember that what happened in El Paso was not simply an attack on America. It was an attack on Latino Americans, who have long been targeted by racists and xenophobes.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Latinos have been targeted in a mass shooting. In June 2016, a gunman killed 49 people at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida – most of them were Latino. And earlier this year, a white nationalist killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso – also predominantly Latino.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, political leaders were quick to offer their thoughts and prayers, but they failed to address the underlying causes of these shootings. They refused to confront the racism and hatred that motivated these attacks.</p>
<p>It’s time for our political leaders to take a stand against racism and hatred. We need to do more to create a safe and inclusive society for all Americans. We need to make sure that everyone feels welcome in our country, regardless of their race or ethnicity.</p>
<h1 id="Shooting-Sparks-Debate-Over-How-Far-is-Too-Far-for-a-Funeral-Home"><a href="#Shooting-Sparks-Debate-Over-How-Far-is-Too-Far-for-a-Funeral-Home" class="headerlink" title="Shooting Sparks Debate Over How Far is Too Far for a Funeral Home"></a>Shooting Sparks Debate Over How Far is Too Far for a Funeral Home</h1><p>Funeral homes have been around in some form for over 6,000 years, with the first documented occurrence in ancient Egypt. They’ve served as a place where the deceased can be mourned and laid to rest and have traditionally been seen as a somber place. In recent years though, a new trend has started to emerge in the funeral home industry – outrageous funerals.</p>
<p>There’s no set definition of what an outrageous funeral is, but they generally involve elements that are far outside the traditional scope of what a funeral is. Some of the most common features are large gatherings, excessive decorations, and over-the-top attire. Many people believe that these funerals are inappropriate and that they cross the line between honoring the deceased and exploiting them for shock value.</p>
<p>The shooting death of rapper Nipsey Hussle earlier this year sparked a heated debate over where to draw the line when it comes to funeral homes. Hussle was gunned down in front of his clothing store in Los Angeles and his memorial service was held at Staples Center, which can accommodate up to 21,000 people. The service was aired live on several television networks and featured performances by Stevie Wonder, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé. While many people praised Hussle’s family for putting on such an impressive event, others felt that it was too much and inappropriate given the circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>Some argue that outrageous funerals are nothing more than a way to grab attention and exploit the deceased. They say that there’s no need for such theatrics when grieving someone who has passed away and that these events only serve to further capitalize on tragedy. Others contend that there’s nothing wrong with celebrating someone’s life in a big way and that these funerals can actually be helpful in terms of closure for friends and family members. They say that if done tastefully, an outrageous funeral can be a fitting tribute to the deceased.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is there such a thing as going too far when it comes to funerals? Or is there no right or wrong answer? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
<h1 id="Tragedy-Reigns-Despite-Miles-Between-Casino-and-Mortuary"><a href="#Tragedy-Reigns-Despite-Miles-Between-Casino-and-Mortuary" class="headerlink" title="Tragedy Reigns Despite Miles Between Casino and Mortuary"></a>Tragedy Reigns Despite Miles Between Casino and Mortuary</h1><p>Las Vegas is a city built on luck. Glittering lights and towering hotels promise visitors the chance to change their fortunes. It’s the place where people come to forget their troubles and believe in the possibilities of luck and pleasure. But for some, luck never comes and tragedy reigns.</p>
<p>Miles away from the glitz and glamour of the casinos lies the mortuary. It’s here that bodies are prepared for burial or cremation, away from the prying eyes of those who still cling to hope. It’s a depressing place, made even more so by its proximity to the bright distractions of the strip.</p>
<p>This juxtaposition is on full display in The Mortuary Museum. Housed in what was once an actual mortuary, the museum showcases artifacts from around the city as well as photographs detailing some of its darker history. One exhibit shows a watch stopped at 4:20, the time many believe Howard Hughes died. His death was ruled a suicide, but there has long been speculation that he was murdered.</p>
<p>Another exhibit focuses on Starburst McGowan, a prostitute whose body was found in an alley behind Circus Circus hotel in 1978. She had been stabbed more than 30 times and her killers were never found. Her case remains open to this day.</p>
<p>The most popular exhibit is The Chair, which is said to have been used by several serial killers including Ted Bundy and Richard Ramirez. It’s said that Ramirez took particular glee in sitting in it while he inflicted pain on his victims.</p>
<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) its dark history, Las Vegas is a fascinating place to visit. The Mortuary Museum is just one small part of it and is well worth a visit for anyone interested in true crime or American history.</p>
<h1 id="Cutler-Neil-Mortuary-Tucked-Away-Nicely-Amidst-Horseshoe-Casino-Nearby"><a href="#Cutler-Neil-Mortuary-Tucked-Away-Nicely-Amidst-Horseshoe-Casino-Nearby" class="headerlink" title="Cutler-Neil Mortuary Tucked Away Nicely Amidst Horseshoe Casino Nearby"></a>Cutler-Neil Mortuary Tucked Away Nicely Amidst Horseshoe Casino Nearby</h1><p>Cutler-Neil Mortuary is a well-maintained, small cemetery that’s tucked away nicely amidst the Horseshoe Casino nearby. It offers a beautiful view of the downtown Cincinnati skyline and is a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p>The cemetery was founded in 1857 by William Cutler and William Neil and is currently operated by their descendants. It features both cremation and traditional burial options, as well as a pet cemetery. The property includes a gazebo, which can be used for memorial services, and a pond, which is home to several geese.</p>
<p>The grounds are impeccably kept and the staff is friendly and helpful. They offer guided tours upon request and will work with you to create a custom funeral or memorial service. Cutler-Neil Mortuary is a beautiful place to say goodbye to a loved one and is definitely worth checking out if you’re in the area.</p>
